Homebrew Google Maps for WebOS (javascript API v3)

This application is trying to be a replacement of unsupported Google Maps application for WebOS devices. The application is based on the Google API V3. Development goal is to get all the features available in API on our WebOS devices and a little more, while maintaining compatibility to the oldest devices with WebOS 1.4.5 up to the newest devices like HP Touchpad. The application seeks to offer a simple and clean user interface. If you like this application, you can donate me in "About" menu.
